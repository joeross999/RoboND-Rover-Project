# Search and Sample Return Project


![alt text][image_0] 

This is my attempt at the Udacity Rover Search and Sample Return Project.  Unfortunately I got pretty busy while working on the project and wasn't able to put as much time as I had hoped.  I hope to later return to this project and improve the rover logic.

## The Simulator
The first step is to download the simulator build that's appropriate for your operating system. Here are the links for Linux, Mac, or Windows.

You can test out the simulator by opening it up and choosing "Training Mode". Use the mouse or keyboard to navigate around the environment and see how it looks.

## Dependencies
You'll need Python 3 and Jupyter Notebooks installed to do this project. The best way to get setup with these if you are not already is to use Anaconda following along with the RoboND-Python-Starterkit.

Here is a great link for learning more about Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks


## Running the Project
To run the project open the simulator and click, autonomus mode.  Then you have to use anaconda to satisfy the dependencies and run the drive_rover.py file.  The image on the bottom left shows what the rover sees and the image on the bottom right shows the world map as the rover explores it.
